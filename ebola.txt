Ebola, also known as Ebola virus disease or Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a viral hemorrhagic fever of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses.
Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches.
Vomiting, diarrhoea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys.
At this time, some people begin to bleed both internally and externally.
The disease has a high risk of death, killing 25% to 90% of those infected, with an average of about 50%.
This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to 16 days after symptoms appear.
